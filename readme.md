[x] Basic Styling

[x] Sorting functionality

## Functionality utilised

1. To sort the plants array alphabetically (A-Z) based on their names:
   - Use the `sort()` method with a comparison function that compares the `name` property of each plant using `localeCompare()`.

2. To implement a button for sorting the plants:
   - Create a separate array (`originalPlants`) to preserve the original order.
   - Use the original array to create and append the product cards initially.
   - Add a button element to trigger the sort functionality.

3. When the sort button is clicked to sort the plants alphabetically:
   - Sort the `originalPlants` array using `sort()` with a comparison function that compares the `name` property.
   - Clear the existing product cards and regenerate them in the sorted order.

4. To sort the plants based on price (high to low):
   - Add a button element to trigger the sort functionality.
   - Sort the `originalPlants` array using `sort()` with a comparison function that subtracts `b.price` from `a.price`.
   - Regenerate the product cards in the sorted order.

5. To sort the plants based on price (low to high):
   - Add a button element to trigger the sort functionality.
   - Sort the `originalPlants` array using `sort()` with a comparison function that subtracts `a.price` from `b.price`.
   - Regenerate the product cards in the sorted order.
